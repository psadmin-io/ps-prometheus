Repository for information on setup and configuration of using Prometheus with PeopleSoft systems.

This is leveraging https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter javaagent to expose the JMX metrics delivered for use with the PeopleSoft Health Center.

Goals are to provide curated config files to expose useful metrics with minimal setup, and to provide sample dashboards for use with Grafana.


Huge thanks to Nate Werner and his JMX metrics and Mike Ripley for his experiments with Javaagents with PeopleSoft.
